/*
  This program is designed to measure the resistance of a sensor or variable resistor connected to an analog pin (A0) of the Arduino.
  It uses a voltage divider circuit to calculate the resistance value of the second resistor (R2) based on the input voltage (Vin) and 
  the voltage measured across the second resistor (Vout).
  
  The goal is to read the analog voltage from the voltage divider, calculate the corresponding resistance of R2, and display the result 
  on the Serial Monitor.
  The program processes the analog input (sensor data) and calculates the resistance, making it an **analog input processing** and 
  **sensor data display** program.
